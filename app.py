Because length affects your setup, which sets eye position, as well as another important specification: weight. These decisions all translate back to your stroke path, which will be directly related to your success rate in getting the ball in the cup. Get that length right for your game, and you're going to increase your odds for success. \n\nTell us more about how the length and weight should affect putter choice?\nLength is very important because it affects your entire setup, from eye position to posture to the putter's weight to the stroke path. If the putter shaft is too long, you stand back and the toe of the putter goes up in the air a bit. When that happens, your effective loft is aimed left and you're almost always going to pull putts. Too short, and you're crouched over. The eyes are outside of the target line and who knows where your putt is going? It's difficult to correct poor setup. Getting the length right for you so that the eyes remain about an inch inside the target line is what we've found to be the optimal setup. \n\nRegarding weight, we match the putter's length with a headweight that achieves a balanced swing weight. With our interchangeable sole weights, we can dial in the headweight to ensure that the putter doesn't feel either whippy or lethargic, but just right. \n\nHow are any of the above factors different when working with a Tour player?\nThey're not. Touring professionals also gravitate toward what they like to look at. It's usually where they start. Out on Tour, they may see a putter in our staff bag that appeals to them. Then, they take it out for a practice round and see how it goes. Many will also come to the Putter Studio for a fitting — or just a \"tune-up\" — to understand more about what they're trying to achieve with their putter and stroke. \n\nAll sorts of questions can be answered with the high-speed video data we gather when players come for a fitting. Is the setup working with the putter or against it? Where are the eyes positioned? What's the stroke path? We've been helping the best players in the world get a handle on the data associated with their strokes for a couple decades. It used to be a process reserved for the world's best players at my Putter Studio R&D facility. But, now with our Gallery open in Encinitas, anyone who's interested in a Tour-like fitting can schedule an appointment and come in to get fit like a pro. \n\nAre there any factors that most people don't think about that you'd suggest they explore when making a choice in putter?\nOne of the new ones I would suggest would be to examine your grip choice. What we have found on Tour and in the Putter Studio, is that these bigger grips on certain putters do work better for certain players. For example, the larger grips help to take a lot of the hands and feel out of the stroke. The larger grips help the player to make a stroke that's more of a shoulder turn, robotic and square-to-square. But, these larger grips on more flowing putters (heel and toe-weighted blades) don't seem to be the best match. They're fighting one another. So, we do put larger diameter Matador grips on Futura X and GOLO putters, but keep our smaller Pistolini and Pistolero options on the Select line. Grip choice has always been a factor in your putter setup. But, I think these days it's becoming a larger topic in the overall conversation about choosing the right putter.\n\n## Guide to Buying Used Scotty Cameron Putters\n## Most Desired Models\n- **Newport 2**: The most popular model, used by Tiger Woods to win 14 of his 15 major championships\n- **Del Mar**: Versatile mid-mallet design, newer versions include removable weights in the sole\n- **Phantom X**: Highly sought after due to tour pro usage (Justin Thomas uses a Phantom X 5, Patrick Cantlay uses a Phantom X 5.5)\n- **Vintage Models**: Original Teryllium putters from the mid-1990s and Pro Platinum models from the late 1990s\n\n## Where to Buy\n- **Online**: eBay (research seller ratings), Global Golf, 2nd Swing\n- **In-person**: Local golf retailers and pro shops (allows you to test the putter before purchase)\n\n## What to Look For - Wear and Condition\n- Scotty Camerons require extra care due to their soft materials\n- **Face condition**: Most important area to check—deep markings can affect putting consistency\n- **Teryllium models**: Check for rust if not oiled regularly\n- **Stainless steel models**: Look for dings and dents if headcover wasn't used\n- Always verify that the description matches the pictures\n- Ask for additional photos if anything is unclear\n\n## Customization Options\n- Scotty's Custom Shop can personalize your putter\n- Services range from simple paint fill and new grips to full restorations\n- Turnaround time: 3-4 months for full restorations\n- Cost: Up to $1,000 for complete customization\n\n## Red Flags and Deal-Breakers\n- Severe face defects\n- Signs of repairs, especially bonding issues\n- Counterfeit putters (particularly common with \"too good to be true\" pricing)\n- If uncertain about authenticity, ask for the serial number and verify with Titleist\n- Remember: If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is.
